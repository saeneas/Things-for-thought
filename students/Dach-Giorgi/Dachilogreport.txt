30.10.24 - Base Idea started in handheld bacteria scanner -- stuck at finding parts for the assembly. 
Alternative pov - Mushroom identifier, eg tool for hunter gathererers - going back to the roots.

01.11.24 - 02.11.24 - After reading part of "an Immense World" (some snakes hunt through detecting vibrations and subtle movements that accompany heartbeats) 
and the talk about how much more sensitive api could be to the data given, I have started reasearch about how unique a heatrbeat could be to a person, and how well is this point is researched or used.

possible compact modules for teaching and use - 
• AD8232 Heart Rate Monitor/ECG Sensor: A low-power ECG sensor capable of detecting heart rate and waveform patterns, ideal for creating unique heartbeat profiles.
• MAX30102 Pulse Oximeter and Heart-Rate Sensor: Measures oxygen saturation and heart rate via optical sensors, commonly used in wearables for real-time monitoring.
• MPU6050 Gyroscope/Accelerometer: Provides motion and vibration data, useful for detecting subtle body movements associated with cardiac activity.
• Panasonic ERT-J0EG103FA NTC Thermistor: Measures temperature changes, which could support tracking physiological variations in health monitoring contexts.

interesting use case for me - as a part of adventure/going back to the roots point, obtaining bigger connection with items which dont posses as much weight nowdays 
as they did in the past like a knife which unlockes after hearing the heart of the owner. (not practical, more "symbolic")


side research / ideas - things for thoats
• Tools for protests
• Signs catcher (Sensors and mainly all tech like good example a flipper zero sense the world in a completle different way from human 5 senses - a device that would catch Signs
• pattrns somewhat spiritual mimicing human tendency to look for signs)
• spiral dynamics developmental levels
  Mind maps
• Digital Ethnography
