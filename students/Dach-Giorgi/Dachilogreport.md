Base Idea started in handheld bacteria scanner -- stuck at finding parts for the assembly. 
Alternative pov - Mushroom identifier, eg tool for hunter gathererers - going back to the roots.

After reading part of "an Immense World" (some snakes hunt through detecting vibrations and subtle movements that accompany heartbeats) 
and the talk about how much more sensitive api could be to the data given, I have started reasearch about how unique a heatrbeat could be to a person, 
and how well is this point researched or used.

possible compact modules for teaching and use - 
• AD8232 Heart Rate Monitor/ECG Sensor: A low-power ECG sensor capable of detecting heart rate and waveform patterns, ideal for creating unique heartbeat profiles.
• MAX30102 Pulse Oximeter and Heart-Rate Sensor: Measures oxygen saturation and heart rate via optical sensors, commonly used in wearables for real-time monitoring.
• MPU6050 Gyroscope/Accelerometer: Provides motion and vibration data, useful for detecting subtle body movements associated with cardiac activity.
• Panasonic ERT-J0EG103FA NTC Thermistor: Measures temperature changes, which could support tracking physiological variations in health monitoring contexts.

interesting use case for me - as a part of adventure/going back to the roots point, obtaining bigger connection with items which dont posses as much weight nowdays 
as they did in the past like a knife which unlockes after hearing the heart of the owner. (not practical, more "symbolic")


side research / ideas - things for thoats
• Tools for protests
• Signs catcher (Sensors and mainly all tech like good example a flipper zero sense the world in a completle different way from human 5 senses - a device that would catch Signs
• pattrns somewhat spiritual mimicing human tendency to look for signs)
• spiral dynamics developmental levels
  Mind maps
• Digital Ethnography

Carrier bag theory of fiction - 
Very interesting, It reminded me of a quote I had saved on tumbler a while ago (im still using tumbler not ashamed of it) and apperantly its also hers from another book

" We have been so desensitized by a hundred and fifty years of ceaselessly expanding technical prowess that we think nothing less complex and 
showy than a computer or a jet bomber deserves to be called "technology" at all. As if linen were the same thing as flax — 
as if paper, ink, wheels, knives, clocks, chairs, aspirin pills, were natural objects, born with us like our teeth and fingers as if
 steel saucepans with copper bottoms and fleece vests spun from recycled glass grew on trees, and we just picked them when they were ripe... "

Some metaphysical aspects of the Knife - Im not sure if its going to end up being a knife but for now Ill stick with the word. 
Its very special to me how after death, the knife in a way kind of dies with the owner.

https://github.com/mullisd1/CV_Heartrate (dark magic)
https://github.com/franciscoj-londonoh/ECG-based-Biometric-Identification
https://github.com/SoufianeDataFan/ECG-authentificate (very useful)

Very important I think to have data not only from finger/pulse but needing to bring an item close to the heart. As ecg needs three connections attached all over your body
Im looking into if the combined data from Single-Lead ECG and PPG Combination Sensor would be enough.
